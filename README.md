# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

The purpose of this project was to figure out which of the reviews were most helpful and if vine status contributes to helpfulness and rating. The dataset in use was focused on reviews of video games. 

# Results 
1. Counting all of the reviews in this dataset, there were almost 4,300 vine reviews and 1.78 million non-vine reviews for a total of about 1.79 million.

# Summary 

Based on the summation of our data, we would need to get more vine reviews in order to have a better idea of any positivity bias. One other additional analysis that could be run once we have more data is a linear regression to see comparisons between different reviews aspects.
